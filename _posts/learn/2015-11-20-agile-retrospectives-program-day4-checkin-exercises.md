Following exercises can be used to set the stage:

 * [Car Brand]
 * [Constellation]
 * [Check-in]

Descriptions of the exercises are from [Oikosofy Blog], category "Agile Retrospecitves".

Some of my learning points from using these exercises: 

 * Once a person has spoken in a meeting, it is more likely that he will speak again.
 * Consider using [Constellation] exercise to start a discussion on touchy subjects where input from the entire team is beneficial. It works great to visualize where every team member stands with respect to the issue at hand.
 * Always follow up the [Constellation] with a short discussion - for example by asking the team what they noticed from the different constellations.
 * Consider adding a color to the car for some additional nuance. A pink Ferrari? A red Land Rover?
