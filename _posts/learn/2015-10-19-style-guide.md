After completing [Code School's Fundamentals of Design course][FoD], I thought I'd write up a small style guide for my site. Voil√†!

##Typography <small>professional yet personal</small>

The audience for my site are people who like to hire me or are interested in what I'm currently doing. I'd like to leave a professional impression with both, with a friendly and personal tone.

I found it quite hard to pick the typefaces to use to match above goals - I guess this is where true designers shine and I go blank. Anyway, I went with the Liberation Sans, -Serif and -Mono as main fonts. I also specified some web-safe falback sans-serif and serif pairs. Body text will always be a serif typeface, headings will always be sans.

Base font size is 18px, which I find pleasantly readable and it works well with the short headlines on the main page. For sizing all other elements, I rely on [Twitter Bootstrap's Customizer][BS] and a custom `config.json` file with LESS variables. The Bootstrap customizer sizes all other fonts relatively to this base size.

##Colors

<span class="label label-default">Default</span>
<span class="label label-primary">Primary</span>
<span class="label label-success">Success</span>
<span class="label label-info">Info</span>
<span class="label label-warning">Warning</span>
<span class="label label-danger">Danger</span>

I used an analoguous color scheme based on the two green colors from my company logog and some tweaking with the [Adobe Color Wheel][Adobe_Color_Wheel] to come to the above color scheme. I mapped the colors to the 5 Bootstrap brand-variables:

```
"@brand-primary": "darken(#009279, 0.5%)",
"@brand-success": "darken(#B5D334, 6.5%)",
"@brand-info": "#C5B4FF",
"@brand-warning": "#D38334",
"@brand-danger": "#AD1B11",
```

##Layout


##Notes

###An outstanding paragraph

To make a paragraph stand out, use the <code>.lead</code> class on a praragraph element.

<p class="lead">Typography is both <strong>Verbal</strong> and <strong>Visual</strong>. The reader surveys the overall graphical patterns of the page, and then parse the language and read. </p>

###A quote

<blockquote>
  <p>Scrum is not an acronym - it is an event in Rugby where a group of like-minded people come together and politely discuss ownership of a ball.</p>
