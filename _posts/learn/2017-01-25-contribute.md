If you see an opportunity to improve posts on my blog,
you can now do so easily by hitting the 
<a href="#"
       class="btn btn-default">
       <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i></a>
edit button on the top of each post.
That will bring you to this site's source code repository on 
[Github]({{ site.github.repository_url }}).

Quickest is to simply use the online editor, which will result in a pull request to me.

Alternatively you can fork the entire site. Whatever suits you best!

Thanks for your help.
