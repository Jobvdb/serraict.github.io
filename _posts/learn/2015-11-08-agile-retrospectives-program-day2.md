title: Agile Retrospectives Program Day 2
---
{% include JB/setup %}

An agile retrospective is the recurring ritual in which the team reflects on its performance, finds ways to improve their performance and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Having -and naming- this ritual explicitly aids in identifying the importance of the event and its goal, allows people to collectively acknowledge important events (be it with grieve or celebration) and creates focus on what is important.

This is my personal summary of what I took from Day 2 of this program.

## Pre-requisites to agile retrospectives

Prime directive:

> ‚ÄúRegardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that
> everyone does the best job he or she could, given what was known at the time,
> his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at
> hand.‚Äù
> *-- [Gon√ßalves 2015]*

 * Create a safe environment
 * Complaints are expressions of thing bothering people, when we formulate complaints as wishes we can create a constructive discussion
 * Have a skilled facilitator

## How to create a safe environment

Generally speaking it is advised to only have participating team memebers in the retrospective. Presence of management ofte leads to shut-down from team members.

Team members decide what will go public.

> "Whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"

I don't know if I fully agree here. But how does the team feel abut this?

Teach team members proper feedback techniques.

Encourage but not force participation.

Location matters. Change location (terrace, bar, ... ) can really change the mood of the team.

Further investigation: Design the Team Alliance and Organisational Relationship System Coaching.

DTA:

 * Create the culture - what culture does your team want to create? 
 * Share responsibility - for both outcome and culture.
 * This alliance can be written down in the fom of desires and agreements.
 * Can (should) be updated from time to time.

## The Facilitator

The facilitator has several responsobilities:

 * Create environment wehre everybody is comfortable to speak
 * Encourage everybody to speak
 * Clarify insights - make sure each insight is understood by everybody in the room
 * Challenge insights with questions
 * Make sure there is a positive atmosphere in the room, focussing on constructively improving the future.
 * Choose exercises that fit the situation at hand. There are several resources, including Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives [[Gon√ßalves, Linders]] and the [Oikosofy Blog]
 * Summarize the restrospective

Possible pitfalls

 * Make decisions for the team. Instead, help the team make their own.
 * Take sides in a discussion. Instead help the team members understand each other.

## Five stages

### Stage 1: Set the Tone

### Stage 2: Gather Data

### Stage 3: Generate Insights

### Stage 4: Determine Actions

### Stage 5: Close the Retrospective


## My learning points and questions?

It is important for the facilitator to clarify the insights and challenge them by asking questions. This is what I find the hard part - asking open questions that clarify our insights without making "my point". 

What is our DTA? Is it explicit or mostly implicit?
