One of the hardest parts of facilitating agile retrospectives (for me at least) is helping the team identify the most urgent problems and define actions that can be done *tomorrow*. Often, we come up with a rather long list of stuff we could or should do, with items that are vague and not immediately actionable.

In the retrospective, we should make sure:
 
 * we commit to a single area of improvement and find the root cause;
 * pick a small number of actions to take (in the next sprint) to improve in  this area;
 * define success criteria for these actions.

## Finding the root cause

According to [Gonçalves 2015] it is important to find the root cause, because

 * only then we will address the *real* issue;
 * it will save us time - if we do not fix the root cause, the problem will keep occuring, only in different forms;
 * killing the root will kill a whole tree of problems;
 * it will lead to action items that are not "fluffy".

This all being said I'm not really sure if there is really a single root cause for every problem. However, if there are more than a single root cause, working on one of those is always better than working on a branch of the tree.

## Work on a small number of small actions

We can only do so much; by defining small actions, we get better insight in the cause of changes we accomplish. Furthermore, small actions actually get done.

Tips to get stuff done are:

 * Appoint an ambassador for an action item;
 * Add action items to (the top of) the sprint backlog;
 * Ask about them in the daily (an ambassador could do this too);
 * Have a dedicated Kanban board for action items;
 * Define success criteria for each action and verify if they're met.
