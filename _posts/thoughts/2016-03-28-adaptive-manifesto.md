Manifesto for Adaptive Software Development. 
Does that sound right to you?
If so, that's not strange, because the 
[Manifesto for Agile Software Development]
almost got that name:

> ... we spent about an hour doing a word search [...]
> what word would characterize this thing that we're doing
> that would give it a positive label [...]
> the top-two words were "Agile" and "Adaptive".
> To a narrow vote we chose Agile,
> and it was the right choice,
> but in fact you need both.
