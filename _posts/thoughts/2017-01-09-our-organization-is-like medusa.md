If we, the people in our organization, feel our organization resembles [Medusa],
an ugly monster, deadly when only looked at,
then how does that make us feel about the mirror that is Scrum?

But Medusa was not defeated because she looked at her own reflection in a mirror.
She was defeated by a brave hero (Perseus),
who, before slaying her,
approached her backwards using the reflections in his mirrored shield.

I'd like to think of Scrum as that shield.
That would make the courageous people going through the change process the Perseus
(mortal hero) of our story.
It's scary, but it needs to be done.
The shield that is Scrum might proof to be helpful in unexpected ways.

And let's keep in mind that
from the slain body of Medusa sprang Pegasus,
a beautiful, winged, dare I say agile, horse.
