As a Scrum Master, it is my job 
to support the team and the organization
on their journey through a complex domain.

Because we're in a complex domain 
the outcomes of our actions are unpredictable. 
This makes our journey exploratory in its very nature - 
there is no right or wrong direction. 

As a Scrum Master I must make sure we travel the right way,
thereby installing the confidence within the team and organization
that we will end up where we want to be,
without knowing where that place is beforehand.

As a Scrum Master I shall make sure that the journey is worthwile.
