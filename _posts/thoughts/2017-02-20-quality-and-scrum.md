### Quality in Scrum

For some reason,
there appears to be tension between speed of delivery 
and perceived (lack of) quality awareness [1], [2].
In my opinion
the true tension often lies in the fact that 
as a Development Team
and as a development organization,
we often fail to make our level of quality sufficiently visible to all.

> Quality is value to someone.

> [Weinberg], Agile and Definition of Quality

To achieve a certain level of quality,
your Development Team has to do a certain amount of work.
If there is a shared understanding of the level of quality required
by your particular context,
then it is clear to everybody 
which work must be done to deliver a [Releasable] 
Product Increment to your customers.

In Scrum this shared understanding *is* the [Definition of Done].
At the very least, your Development Team must be transparent 
with respect to its adopted level of quality,
as part of making transparent all the work 
that is needed to transform 
Product Backlog into a [Done] Product Increment.

You don't go fast by *not* doing work that is essential 
to meet the required level of quality.
That is hiding work or deferring learning that at some point needs to be done.

You don't go fast by doing *more* work 
than is needed to meet the adopted level of quality.
Then you're doing work that is not needed - 
stuff that *is not* of value to someone important.
Doing unneeded stuff is number 2 on the list of of 
[the seven wastes of our industry]. 
Number 1 on that list is partially done work.

In Scrum, as an organization and as a Development Team,
you prevent neglecting work that actually should be done
and prevent doing unnecessary work 
by [collaboratively defining quality] appropriate for your particular context.

If your Definition of Done is perfectly adapted to the situation at hand
then you have minimized a lot of waste in your process.
Since your Development Team does the best job it can,
then you'll go as fast as you responsibly can go.

### Resources

These are the resources used in this post:

 * [1],[2] on Scrum Myths on speed and quality
 * Gerald Weinberg: [Weinberg on quality][Weinberg]
 * Gunther Verheyen: [collaboratively defining quality], 
   [Done] in Scrum and [Releasable] in Scrum
 * Scrum Guide: [Definition of Done]

If you'd like to further explore 
the concept of quality in the context of (agile) software development,
I strongly recommend [Weinberg's books on quality].

Another interesting exploration trail might [the work of Mary and Tom Poppendieck]
on lean software development.
