How do you feel about "putting pressure on the team"?

Writing software, testing software and stakeholder interaction to clarify requirements typically require active, deliberate thought processes performed in our [prefrontal cortex]. Processing stress (as well as hunger and other emotions) is done in our [limbic system], which takes precedence over other parts of the brain. This results in less oxygen and blood flowing to the prefrontal cortex, resulting in degraded performance of that area.

My conclusion: teams that don't experience stress perform better on typical tasks performed in software development.
