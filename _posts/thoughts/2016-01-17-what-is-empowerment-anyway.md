I don't get empowerment - what does it mean for me to empower you? Is there some "power" over there that I can magically transfer to you thereby empowering you? Who am I to "empower" anybody. Why do you need empowerment? 

Who are you to empower me?

At best, empowerment means helping yourself or others realize that the power comes from within. [I've got the power in me, you've got the power you][power in me]. As a manager, or leader, we should create the environment for our teams to unlock their powers. If that's what you mean by empowerment, then I'm in.
