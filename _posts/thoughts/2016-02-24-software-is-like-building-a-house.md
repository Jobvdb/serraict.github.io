> I often hear that “a good software project must, like a house, start on strong foundations of good architecture and good requirements”. My usual answer is: “sure, if you consider that you can start by building a tent, then evolve it into a hut, then increment it into a trailer, and later on deliver a castle, then yes, you could say that building software is the same as building a house.”
