> *President Roslin*: What I need to know and what might keep you alive is exactly how to find the Tomb of Athena.
> 
> *Sharon*: Get me a map and I'll do my best to tell you how to get to the Tomb.
> 
> *Roslin*: No, you do better than your best. And I want to know where the Tomb is and you either know or you don't.
> 
> *Sharon*: We all know about the Tomb and I can show you the path. I don't know where the path leads to and how long it will take, but I do know you need to move very, very quickly.
