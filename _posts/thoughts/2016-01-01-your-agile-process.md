<blockquote>

    <p>Some people think they are important [...] and they feel that gives them the right to tell people what to do and how to do it. These people are turkeys. Don't let them tell you what to do.</p>

    <p><strong>I</strong> am a turkey. Don't let <strong>me</strong> tell you what to do either.</p> 

    <p>In fact, all experts are turkeys. We tell you what to do and how to do it. And that is wrong [...] because no rules are universal and all rules require context.</p>
