title: What is a servant-leader anyway?
---

{% include JB/setup %}

According to the [Scrum Guide],
"The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team".
What does it mean to be a servant-leader?

My initial plan was to do some research,
and write a short summary here.
While reading, I found that thinking of servant-leadership 
was more valuable if I'd be able to formulate what it means,
to me personally,
to be a servant-leader to my teams. 
So that's what I ended up doing.

Being a servant-leader is as much about
creating a personal view on servant-leadership it self, 
take this view to heart 
and start living by it.

These are my takes on servant leadership, 
in no particular order. 
I'll try to live by them.
I'll fail often - but I promise I'll do my best and keep trying.

People who know me might not recognize me in the vows below ... 
that's fine, they're probably right and I don't claim to be there yet.
I do claim to be moving in that direction though 
and you can hold me accountable to that.

## My personal take on servant leadership

As a servant leader ...

I will respect people, 
appreciate them for who they are 
and help them see and reach their potential.

I will support self-organization. 

I will welcome feedback.

I will be gentle and patient.

I will [not understand empowerment],
 - instead will help people discover the power that already is within them.

I will not enforce my will on others. 

I will not expect people to follow
 - the leader is chosen by those who choose to follow. 

I will work to create a safe environment 
 - an environment safe for failure and success. 

I will lead by example. 

I will follow
 - but never blindly and always cautiously. 

I will credit others for their contributions and effort. 

I will speak out if effort is not good enough. 

I will empathize.

I will take pride in helping others grow.

I will actively listen and be aware with all senses.

I will be firm in my beliefs
 - yet open-minded for other points of view.

I will be persuasive but never forceful.

## Resources

These were my takes - what are yours?

I came to the list above through reading the following resources,
which I encourage you to explore too.

I came across to two great introductory blog post 
on the subject of Scrum Masters as servant leaders.
In his post [The Scrum Master as servant leader], 
Barry Overeem gives a succinct review of Servant Leadership 
in the context of Scrum and Agile Software Development.
A great accompanying read is [A question about the Scrum Master][adaptagility],
where James Scrimshire covers similar ground.

Of course, the canonical resource on servant-leadership is the essay 
"Servant as Leader" by Robert K. Greenleaf,
available through [greanleaf.org] or [google].
To me this was a thought-provoking read. 
Normally it would take me an hour at most to read a 27-page document,
but this took me an entire morning.
Perhaps because of quotes like: 
"The prudent man is one who constantly thinks of 'now' 
as the moving concept in which
past, present moment, and future,
are one organic unity.".
Quotes like this either have me throw the book out of the window,
or read them again and ponder. 
The latter happened in the case of this particular paper,
at this particular morning.

If you have read mr. Greenleaf's essay, 
you might interested in some further explorations of the servant-leadership tenets 
and some academic critisism in this research paper by [Carol Smith].
