I collect feedback from all team members I have collaborated with as a Scrum Master.
Part of this feedback is an [exit survey].
After our collaboration has ended,
I request all team members I have worked with for more than two sprints to fill out this survey. 
On this page I present the results.

Some might call it transparency, but I transparently declare this page to be honest self-promotion as well.

Nevertheless, the request for feedback is genuine, as are the reponses. 
This feedback as well as my day-to-day interaction with my team members help me to improve my Scrum Master play.

### Survey results

Once I have collected more than five response, I wil present some results here. In the mean time, you will have to make do with the quotes below.

### What do others have to say about me?
