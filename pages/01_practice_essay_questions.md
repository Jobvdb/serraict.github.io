I came across 
[these preparation questions on Simon Kneafsey's blog] 
for the PSM2 exam.

Here are my answers, please provide your feedback below or contact me.

I had a hard time writing these answers within 30 minutes,
they took me slightly over 45 minutes.

### Refinement

> Product Backlog refinement is not a mandatory Scrum event. 
> Why is this and what is Product Backlog refinement?

PBR is defined as an activity in the Scrum Guide and not as a mandatory Scrum event.
Teams can *choose* to do PBR in a designated meeting, if that suits them.
However, teams may find other good ways do PBR; for instance, I've seen teams do PBR 
everyday for about 15 minutes (timeboxed) after lunch or before the daily.

Backlog refinement is the activity of getting 
the top of the backlog into sprint-ready state.
Refined backlog items typically have clear acceptance criteria
and are small enough to comfortably fit in a sprint.
Teams might have specific criteria for items being sprint-ready
(e.g. INVEST)
but the thing I'm looking for in refinements 
is constructive discussion with the aim of
finding the smallest pieces of work 
that deliver the most value.

By not making it a mandatory event, the Scrum Team can find their own way
in balancing focus on sprint execution and doing just enough "looking ahead".
A distinct event is not needed, hence not prescribed,
keeping Scrum as empty as possible
while staying true to inspection, adaptation and agile principles.

### Daily Standup

> “The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.” 
> – The Scrum Guide.
>
> What does this mean and why is it important?

The Daily Scrum is a meeting for the Dev Team,
in which they can inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal
and adapt accordingly.
This means that only dev team members participate in a focused
discussion concerning their work (e.g. by answering the three questions).
This is their responsibility and they know best how to do it.
The daily is for the dev team and serves no other goals,
such as status updates for others.

By helping others respecting the daily by NOT participating,
the dev team can be completely transparent and open in the meeting,
yielding to them the best results.

By helping others respecting the daily by NOT participating,
the dev team be focused on what is needed (or is blocking them)
for focused sprint execution towards their goal.

That being said, I often find it useful if the PO is present at the daily,
and often find that the dev team aligns with the PO quickly during the daily.
It is also a good moment for the PO to ask the team some minor questions
or align wrt meetings with customers or users requiring involvement of the Dev Team.
But strictly speaking this should not be part of the daily scrum.

### Agile in a non-agile environment

> Is it possible to be agile in an environment where timelines, budget and scope are fixed?

Yes it is. Agile is about individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and adapting to change.

The latter is being made *very* difficult (nearly impossible) by fixing budget, timelines and scope.
When fixing timeline, budget and scope, 
adapting to change can be done by cutting quality,
which I'm generally opposed to,
but could (should?) be considered as an option.
There is (slightly) more room for the other three core values.

However, if the environment fixes timelines, budget and scope
this might indicate close-to-unethical behavior,
because the assumption that all is known beforehand,
everything will go as expected,
scope is spot-on
AND someone (or some team) had the immense insight 
*that* and *how* this could be done,
is very close to a lie
that puts unrealistic stress on those doing the work
and presents unfair expectations to those sponsoring or using the work.

So I would not advice an agile approach
to organizations making these assumptions about timeline, budget and scope.
Because if those assumptions were true,
they'd better put their team in an inspiring environment,
leave them alone during the realization of the product
and then happily accept whatever the team comes up with.

An agile approach yields the best results when pursued 
in all openness
by all involved
with everybody doing their best, 
based on what they know at the moment.
All should continuously verify their assumptions 
(including those on plan, budget and scope) 
and be willing to adapt (change) them when our insight grows.

If this is not the case, we should not expect great benefits
from "doing agile".

Summarizing: possible, yes, but extremely difficult and I would strongly advise against using an agile approach in this type of context.

### Mechanical vs Professional Scrum

> Explain the difference between “Mechanical” Scrum and “Professional” Scrum

I'm not fully aware of these terms, so let me define them first:

Mechanical Scrum: an adaptation of Scrum, where the team and organization
has implemented Scrum by the book; they do all the events, 
have assigned all the roles and deliver a working increment every sprint.

Professional Scrum: an adaptation of Scrum that 
(might have started out as Mechanical Scrum and) 
has led the team and organization 
to discover the values and principles of Scrum
and thereby
to continuously improve their product and process
to better and quicker serve their users and customers,
and to a more joyous and innovative work space.

In mechanical scrum, the team and organization go through the motions 
(of Scrum, of their respective context)
but don't utilize the transparency Scrum provides 
wrt their own work and context
to improve it 
by addressing the most important issues.
This aspect of Scrum can be hard and it 
takes courage, perseverance and discipline
that not all teams and organizations have.

In my opinion, 
this courage, perseverance and discipline 
to inspect the tough problems and adapt to them 
is what shows the truly professional Scrum Team.
