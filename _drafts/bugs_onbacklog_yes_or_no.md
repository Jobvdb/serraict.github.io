I say no.

i prefer no bugs policy

don't estimate bugs or award "velocity points" to the team for fixing bugs or doing spikes

(technical uncertainty: will be reflected in lower velocity)
(time spent on bug fixing will be visible in lower velocity)

because this makes prediction more transparant

given our normal time spend on bugs

we expect to cover this much ground feature wise

there is tons of waste in bug management
