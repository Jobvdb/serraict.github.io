Incentives with negative consequences are called perverse incentives; asking developers to reach a particular code coverage goal is clearly a perverse incentive. It doesn't matter whether you set the target at 100% code coverage, 90%, 80%, or some other number.

Sufficiency of testing is much more complicated attribute than coverage can answer. I would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:

You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.

-- Martin Fowler, from http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html

If a part of your test suite is weak in a way that coverage can detect, it's likely also weak in a way coverage can't detect.
